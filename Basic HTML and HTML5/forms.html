    <!--
        radio buttons
        type of input
        each needs to be nested in its own label element
        by wrapping input in label, it will associate the radio button with the label element surrounding it

        All related radio buttons have the same name element to create a group

        By creating a group, selecting any single radio button will deselect the otehr buttons within the same group

        This ensures only one option is selected by the user
    -->
    <label for="indoor-outdoor">
        <input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor">Indoor
        <input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor">Outdoor
    </label>

    <!--
        checkboxes

        type of input

        each has its own label element
        by wrapping input in a label, it will automatically associate the checkbox with the label surrounding it

        all related checkboxes should have the same name attribute

        best practice is to explicitly define relationship between a checkbox input and corresponding label by setting for attribute on the label to match the id of the input
    -->
    <label for="loving">
        <input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="loving"> Loving
        <input id="cranky" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="cranky"> Cranky
    </label>

    <!--
        value attribute

        inputs of type radio and checkbox report values from the value attribute

        If you omit the value attribute, the form will submit withe the default value, which is on.

        So you would get indoor-outdoor=on, which is not useful

        check radio buttons and checkboxes by default with checked attribute
    -->

    <input type="radio" name = "test-name" checked>

    <!--
        submit buttons
    -->
    <button type="submit">this button submits the form</button>
</form>
